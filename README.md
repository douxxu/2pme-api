## FAQ

### Is there a command line tool to manage subdomains ?
**Yes**, you can find it on [NPM](https://npmjs.com/package/2pme) or make your own version out of the [Source code](https://git.douxx.tech/2pme-cli).

### Is there a dashboard to manage subdomains ?
**Not actually**, but it will probably be made.

### Is there a python api wrapper ?
**No**, and i'm not planing to make one. You can easily use the `requests` module and the [documentation](https://2peek.me) to make one yourself.
